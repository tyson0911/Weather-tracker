Approach


    The app was designed with a focus on simplicity and usability. The interface is clean and intuitive, making it easy for users to access weather information.

    The app uses the browser's Geolocation API to automatically fetch the user's location and display local weather data. This provides a personalized experience for users.

    The app fetches real-time weather data and forecasts from the OpenWeatherMap API using Axios. This ensures that users always see the most up-to-date information.

    The app is fully responsive, with media queries ensuring that it looks great on all devices, from desktops to mobile phones.

    A toggle button allows users to switch between Celsius and Fahrenheit, enhancing the app's usability for a global audience.


Challenges Faced


    Handling API Errors:

        Challenge: The app needed to handle errors gracefully, such as when a city is not found or the API request fails.

        Solution: Implemented error handling in the fetchWeather function to display user-friendly error messages.

    Geolocation Permissions:

        Challenge: Users might deny location access, breaking the app's functionality.

        Solution: Added a fallback mechanism that prompts users to manually enter a city if location access is denied.

    Responsive Hourly Forecast:

        Challenge: Displaying the hourly forecast in a scrollable horizontal layout while ensuring it looks good on all screen sizes.

        Solution: Used CSS Flexbox and media queries to create a responsive and scrollable hourly forecast section.

    Temperature Unit Conversion:

        Challenge: Dynamically converting temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit without making additional API calls.

        olution: Implemented a conversion function that updates the displayed temperatures when the unit is toggled.
